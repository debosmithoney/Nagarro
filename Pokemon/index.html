          Pokémon(an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters in Japan) is a Japanese
          media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a company founded by
          Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by
          Satoshi Tajiri in 1996,and is centered on fictional creatures called
          "Pokémon". In Pokémon, humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and
          train Pokémon to battle other Pokémon for sport. All media works
          within the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The English
          slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch ‘Em All!". There are
          currently 913 Pokémon species.<br /><br />
          The original Pokémon is a role-playing game based around building a
          small team of monsters to battle other monsters in a quest to become
          the best. Pokémon are divided into types, such as water and fire, each
          with different strengths. Battles between them can be likened to the
          simple hand game rock-paper-scissors. For example, to gain an
          advantage over a Pokémon that cannot beat an opponent’s Charizard
          character because of a weakness to fire, a player might substitute a
          water-based Pokémon. With experience, Pokémon grow stronger, gaining
          new abilities. By defeating Gym Leaders and obtaining Gym Badges,
          trainers garner acclaim.

          In 1998, Nintendo spent $25 million promoting Pokémon in the United
          States in partnership with Hasbro, KFC, and others.[14] Nintendo
          initially feared that Pokémon was too Japanese for Western tastes but
          Alfred Kahn, then CEO of 4Kids Entertainment convinced the company
          otherwise.[15] The one who spotted Pokemon's potential in the United
          States was Kahn's colleague Thomas Kenney.[16] In November 2005, 4Kids
          Entertainment, which had managed the non-game related licensing of
          Pokémon, announced that it had agreed not to renew the Pokémon
          representation agreement. The Pokémon Company International oversees
          all Pokémon licensing outside Asia.[17] In 2006, the franchise
          celebrated its tenth anniversary.[18] In 2016, the Pokémon Company
          celebrated Pokémon's 20th anniversary by airing an ad during Super
          Bowl 50 in January and re-releasing the first Pokémon video games 1996
          Game Boy games Pokémon Red, Green (only in Japan), and Blue, and the
          1998 Game Boy Color game Pokémon Yellow for the Nintendo 3DS on
          February 26, 2016.[19][20] The mobile augmented reality game Pokémon
          Go was released in July 2016.[21] The first live-action film in the
          franchise, Pokémon Detective Pikachu, based on the 2018 Nintendo 3DS
          spin-off game Detective Pikachu, was released in 2019.[22] The eighth
          generation of core series games began with Pokémon Sword and Shield,
          released worldwide on the Nintendo Switch on November 15, 2019.

          Ash Ketchum (Japanese: サトシ Satoshi) is the main character of the
          Pokémon anime. He is also the main character of various manga based on
          the anime, including The Electric Tale of Pikachu, Ash & Pikachu, and
          Pocket Monsters Diamond & Pearl. He is a Pokémon Trainer from Pallet
          Town whose goal is to become a Pokémon Master. His starter Pokémon was
          a Pikachu that he received from Professor Oak after arriving late at
          his laboratory. On his journeys around the Pokémon world, he's been
          accompanied by a multitude of close friends. In Pokémon the Series:
          Sun & Moon, he becomes the first Champion of the Alola region's
          Pokémon League. In Pokémon Journeys: The Series, he becomes one of the
          eight best Trainers in the world within the World Coronation Series.
          He shares his Japanese name with the creator of the Pokémon franchise,
          Satoshi Tajiri. His English surname is a pun of the English motto,
          "Gotta catch 'em all!."

          Pikachu, a yellow mouselike creature, is the undisputed face of
          Pokémon and helped the series become a worldwide phenomenon. Pokémon
          inspired a cartoon series, movies, books, a toy line, sequels,
          spin-offs, a clothing line, and a popular trading-card game. In spite
          of a friendly interface and little violence, Pokémon has not been
          without controversy, however. In 1999 the parents of two nine-year-old
          boys sued Nintendo, stating that the Pokémon card game had caused the
          children to develop gambling problems and likening the trading-card
          craze to an illegal lottery. Religious groups that discount the theory
          of evolution also targeted Pokémon, for showing Pokémon evolving into
          new creatures.
